# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Odin Project

This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe designed by me for The Odin Project. 

Press run to start the game. 

Firstly, each player choose their marker "X" and "O".

Then each player take turn to choose the position they want to place their marker. 

The winner wins when the player manage to form 3 of their marker horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 

Run the game again if you want to restart :)

Enjoy :)
